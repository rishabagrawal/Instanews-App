## Journey - what i have learned and enjoyed creating ! 

One of the most satisfying project creating a news website using a API and calling its value like multimedia, abstract, and urls by making ajax calls (json). Filtering and slicing image so that we are not only removing the error but also having 12 stories appear rather than 40. 

A great learning experience was understanding specification and importance of order. Furthemore small animation adds value to creativity but further enhances user interaction with the website. We were also introduced to scss this week and even though it can be tricky at first but makes life whole lot easier to read our css and do media queries.
